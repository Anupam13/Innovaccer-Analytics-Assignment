# DEPENDENCIES: 

- python3 pandas library
- Anaconda IDE(Spyder 3.6)



# RUNNING THE CODE:
<br>The code can be run by opening the file Innovaccer.py in Spyder 3.6 
The python file and input file should be in the same directory or the woking directory may need to be changed.
The required files for it are Innovaccer.py and input.csv. <br/>
<br>With each example having attribute first name, last name, dob, gender.<br/>
<br>The output will be generated in Output.csv.<br/>
<br>These names can be changed from input.csv<br/>
